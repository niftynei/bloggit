In 1954, Alan Turing published a paper titled "The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis". In it, he laid out a novel theory of leopards get their spots -- via the reaction diffusion systems of chemical molecules, which radiated their way upward into observable phenomena. Here's a short description of what a 'reaction-diffusion' system is, 

> Reactionâ€“diffusion systems are mathematical models which correspond to several physical phenomena: the most common is the change in space and time of the concentration of one or more chemical substances: local chemical reactions in which the substances are transformed into each other, and diffusion which causes the substances to spread out over a surface in space.

(The first nucleic acid was sequenced in 1965).

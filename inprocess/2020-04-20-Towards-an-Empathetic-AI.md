Sometimes my brain comes up with strange insights into the nature of reality. I don't exactly know where they come from, but they're certainly entertaining. One such insight that I've been mulling over for quite a while now is the idea that "every human is an AI".

This isn't necessarily novel or new, in fact I'm fairly certain I saw a podcast or lecture recently[1] where someone else made this exact same claim or analogy. 

What is novel, I think, is the way that I've been using it to think through my interactions with others. Given that I am an AI with a 'human compatible communication interface', what kind of service am I providing to the humans that choose to interact with me?

## The Human Compatible Communication Interface
Before I get into the 'Terms of Service' that I, as an AI offer up to other humans, first let's talk a bit about what exactly I mean by 'human compatible communication interface'. Perhaps we should approach it by restating the term: how do humans communicate with each other?

Well, this seems fairly simple to figure out. The most obvious answer is that humans communicate with each other via words, both spoken and written. So as an AI, I can communicate thoughts to other humans by producing written texts and documents. 

As a brief aside, there's a bit of finesse here in terms of getting the text to the receiving-AI system. You have to deliver it along a communication channel that they're known to frequent; they must be motivated to read it; you're sort of assuming that they talk the same language and have enough context for the situation to be able to understand what you've written and update their internal state accordingly. A lot of these things can be missed when attempting to communicate via text.

Text communication isn't the only way of reaching a human, however. There's also the spoken component, where you can say words out loud and another human will hear the noises that you've made and understand what you're saying. Voice communication carries a lot more than text communication does - it also serves to transmit the communication-producer's present emotional state. Not to say that words don't also convey emotional state, however it's much easier for another human to read written words and fail to grasp the full range of experience that the text-producing AI intended to relay. Vocal communication registers with the receiving-AI's "vocal communication system", so to speak, which requires a) much less mental processing and reconstruction to fully grasp the total meaning of the message and b) has a much more likely chance of triggering an emotional response in the receiving-AI.

This emotional response that you, AI, can produce via interacting with an other AI is a part of the communication interface. There are emotional states that are difficult if not impossible to reach without the correct AI-to-AI interaction. Inter-AI communication is non-determininstic, as the receptive feedback loops produced between two AIs communicating 


It's fun to use this paradigm to describe common communication failures. For example, in the case where you feel that someone "isn't listening", we can redefine this to be "their feedback loop is not attuned to my

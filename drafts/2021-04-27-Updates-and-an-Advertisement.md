It would seem that I haven't been as prolific in writing updates as I have in the past. There's a good reason for this, but not one that I'm talking about publicly quite yet.

In other news, I wanted to let you know that I've got two other places that I've been writing content lately. 

Why not put the writing here, on basic bitch? 

I really like having different places to put writing, the idea being that each 'writing place' contains slightly different content, targeted at a (slightly) different audience. I bucket myself so that you can selectively tune in to what you're interested in!

I also find it really useful for bucketing my thoughts into expression silos, as it gives me a grid to shape the thoughts by audience and exhibition type.

This blog is mainly concered with software, especially the experience of building and running software. 

I work in crypto, specifically on the lightning network, so there is admittedly a bit of musings about crypto projects here.[1]

In the meantime, if you'd like to see more and different types of content (but in the same cheeky-basic bitch style) you should check out my two new newsletters.

- [niftynei's shitcoin chronicles](https://chainfail.substack.com). A paid Substack where I've started telling all about my home crypto mining adventures. I've been running miners at home since early 2019, so as you can imagine I've got lots of well, um, shit to share. Note that this is paid only. It costs $5.99 a month, or $59.99 for the whole year (what a deal!). If you'd like to pay for a whole year in bitcoin or some other crypto currency, send me an email or DM on Twitter and I'll get you an address to pay me at. You can sign up for the free tier. Content you can expect on the free tier is a list of all the posts I've written for the paid tier.

- [niftynei's revue](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/niftynei). This is meant to be a meta-commentary on things I see on Twitter et cetera. It's free, of course. There's no theme other than "things I'm thinking about". There will not be any software or other "tech" related content posted here. So far it's got some thoughts on PR about North Korea, a series of posts on inflation, and some musings about death. The idea is that these posts are inspired by or longer explanations of things I tweet.

Oh, and I'd be remiss not to mention the podcast I've been doing with [Venkat](https://twitter.com/vgr).

- [Scorpio Season TV](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxdmv6Oei95Vm7LAGrz0Zfw). Venkat's a fan of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, so we talk our way through the alphabet. We're almost done with our second season, which at 26 episodes wraps up an entire half a year of weekly chats.

## In Exitus
There hasn't been much content here, but I'd love for you to follow my content other places!

I have a very big TODO list item that is "create a consolidated writing feed" that will make it possible to subscribe to any and all writing that I do in a single place. This doesn't exist yet, but I'll let you know when it does.


[1] Speaking of projects, there's some really great software related stuff coming out of work in the next few weeks and months. I'm looking forward to finally feeling at a place to talk about what I've been working on for the past few years. It's wild to write that, but true so I shouldn't shy away from it. I really enjoy downplaying big efforts because in the day to day of it, it's really a lot of little efforts. Also, it feels embarrassing that it's taken this long. I'm coming to terms with it. I'm excited to have more to tell soon.

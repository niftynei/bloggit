title: A Case for Extravagance

Learning the art of extravagance has made me better at my job (programmer) in ways that may be completely unintuitive at the outset, but make quantifiable sense.

There are not many people who will talk about building indulgent systems. Talk about optimization and efficiency, and reducing 'technical debt' -- these are conversations and dialogs that you can find in abundance. They say a lot about how a system or your code should not be built. I find that they leave plenty of room, however, for a discussion on broader guiding principles of what makes a software system pleasant to use and maintain -- an indulgent system.

I want to preface this with allowing consideration for the fact that my idea of "extravagant" may make more sense as an opposite, as a foil to pure flintiness. Flintiness as in the kind of ruthless frugality that airlines indulge in by making you pay for peanuts and breathing room. Extravagance as what is possible when you're freed from the worry about cost for cost's sake.

I am not an extravagant person by nature. I wasn't raised extravagantly. I wouldn't call myself frugal, but by all means far from extravagant. I do enjoy nice things, and Ive always had a bad habit of greediness. But, extravagant, never. 

I grew up in a frugal home. Not poor, never poor, but astringently frugal. The kind of frugality that dictates no television on weekdays and prefers boneless skinless chicken for both its convenience and relative affordability.

When I left home for college, thru a remarkable series of sheer luck, hapless unbridled optimism, and no small amount of cunning, I arrived with more money in my bank account than most 18 year olds have executive power over, and quite honestly,  more money than has probably been there all at once since. 

I spent the money, but not foolishly. It was all scholarship dollars and it needed to last until I had earned a degree. If you're like me and you grew up frugal, you'll understand what I mean when I say that I felt guilty spending it. Any of it. I once blew $50 on groceries for a particularly nice dinner and felt awful about it. I still feel awful about it. Emotions around money are complex and I'm sliding down a tangent that I'd rather not fall down. Suffice it to say tho that my attitude around spending didn't stop me from doing it, but it made me really despise myself for liking luxurious things. 

So what counts as extravagant? Extravagances are things that I could techincally *survive* without but that having them makes a world if difference in the comfort level of existing. Nice, functional yet pretty things like a woolen scarf with a beautiful pattern. A pair of merino wool lounge pants. Buying myself lunch at the airport at one of the nice sit-down restaurants. Taking a taxi cab home when it's pouring rain or freezing sleet, even though the buses are still running. Packing a spoon for yogurt in your lunch.

One of my resolutions a few years back was to learn how to be extravagant. To master the art of spending lavishly. The motivation for the experiment was curiosity -- how much money would I spend if I did buy myself all.the things I wanted? How far outside of my means could my desires possibly go?  Can money buy me more happiness than I have right now? Instead of thinking in terms of cost, would it be possible to teach myself to think in terms of payoff?
 
 Extravagance, I discovered, is more than the money you spend. It's what that money *enables* that is the true power of cash. 

 To be optimally extravagant, you have to.think ahead. You need foresight into what your future requirements are in order to know what to spend your money on. 

 As an example, let's say that you've signeonceurself up for an extravagant 10 day hiking tour with some friends. As a group you're pooling your resources for the big things, but you're responsible for your own gear. Your budget is limitless. What do you buy? Let's start concretely: you need a sleeping bag. The easy option would be to walk into the nearest sporting goods store and buy the most expensive sleeping bag that they have. Or you could buy the bag that the sales rep recommended. But would that be the bag that is the most comfortable for a 10 day hike in the mountains? It's very probable that it would be, but you.don't know. My definition of extravagance entails having the *best* bag, for me, for my 10 day hike. 

 So how do you find the best bag? In order to define the best, you need a broader understanding of the actual problems that a sleeping bag solves or might encounter.  Such as: How cold might it get? How much does the bag weigh? Can it get wet? If it gets wet, how long will it take to dry? How much space in my backpack will the bag take up? Is it long enough for me? Can I roll over in it without dislocating my pyjama bottoms midroll? 

 Suddenly, extravagance is no longer about the money that you're spending or how long it will take, but about having a clear understanding of what you're trying to accomplish. What is required out of the money you're investing.

 Can you see where I'm going with this? How this kind of questioning and approach to time and money, a goals oriented approach is applicable to building software that is not only extravagantly pleasant to use, but also to extend and work with? Systems that are pleasant to push code to, that are built with a strong idea of their purpose in mind. Extravagantly pleasant systems, that are simple and clear and explicit.

 I enjoy building extravagant systems, now.

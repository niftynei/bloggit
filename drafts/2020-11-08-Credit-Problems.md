## Oops
I got scooped on a project I've been working on last week. To be fair, it's been over two years since I first floated the idea, and a year since I gave a presentation outlining how and why the current work I was doing was important. It's a really damn good idea, and yeah, someone else probably would have had it had I not floated it. But I definitely did some ground work in outlining how it might work and what the generalized impact of such a development would be. I presented a vision, and have been slowly working on one way to achieve it for the past few years.

Another team in the space launched a working version of the idea last week. I think the other team's implementation is, in a lot of ways, strictly better than the approach I've been taking and that it will largely fill the vision I had of how such a project should work, but I have some thoughts about how the work I've been doing and my voicing of the idea was reflected in their presentation.

To be fair, I wasn't the first person to float the idea, but I definitely was the first to present on it and post to the project mailing list about one way it might be achieved. The mailing list post was acknowledged in the whitepaper (wow, I got cited in a whitepaper!), but, weirdly enough, with a co-author. The mailing list post I wrote didn't *have* a co-author. Why would the citation include one? Well, at the bottom of my email I credited someone else for having suggested the idea to me. In a sense, the mention of someone else was a citation of a conversation I had had. 

I'm not very familiar with how citations work, but I don't think it's common for someone cited in an email to be listed as an author of that email.

I feel a bit like I got 'chaperoned' out of the work I've done promoting the idea, and being the first to articulate the impact such a development might have on the whole network. In fact, the paper claimed for itself the novel invention of an idea I had outlined in a presentation a year early.

Man, in writing this post I feel a certain *naivete*. I'm so new to 'research' communities and 'credit' etc. Complaining about this feels really petty -- they shipped first. Their project works. Mine is getting close, very very close, but it's still, realistically, a months away from existing. I think it's fair that they get credit for the project they've shipped and for being the first ones to bring it to market. 

I will say though that if I was doing this for 'making a name for myself in the community for having and shipping great, important ideas', I think the smartest thing to do would be to pack it in and go work on the next thing I think the network needs -- the first mover credit has been drained out of this particular one and, for reasons I don't fully understand, my role in elucidating the importance and potential of such an idea has largely been papered over and minimized. I don't really see a whole lot of personal glory left for me here. I mean, I'm going to finish the thing I've spent a lot of time working on now, but it's not really going to help my career or make me well known as a person who's capable of both outlining a vision and completing it. Anyone who works in this space will, perhaps rightfully, always point to the team that shipped first as the real progenitors of the invention. I guess this is the whole thing about credit right, about why getting your paper out *first* is so important -- because the reputation benefit of doing so is enormously weighted towards the first mover.

I care about the 'loss of opportunistic repuatation points', on some level. On another, I feel pretty validated that the idea I championed was so correct and strategic that the other team put months of work into building a really great working version. At the end of the day, liqiudity markets are a sorely needed thing for the lightning network, and I am really sorry that it's taken such a damn long time for my version to get shipped. It's coming though, I promise! Haha.

In fact, I don't think I'd really care so much, if there wasn't that weird thing where the paper that scooped me had listed the man I cited as the source of the idea as an equivalent author of said email.

## But Why A Chaperone?
On the one hand I'd love to know the rationale for not giving me sole credit for an email I solely wrote. On the other, I'm pretty sure that it wouldn't be very satisfying. In fact, I'm chalking it up to some 'gentle' misogyny. The sort of gentle misogyny that tends to show itself in a gentle breaking of general citation conventions. But I'm new enough here to admit that maybe this is normal?  It's just so crazy to me. No one's ever seen any writing by this man or evidence of his contribution. The only evidence of his contribution is my word that that's where the idea came from. Why put so much effort into giving credit to someone who no one's ever heard from on the topic? Not a single mailing list reply, or blog post, or presenation. Nothing. Just my single reference to him as the progenitor of the idea. And which part of the idea, exactly, am I giving him credit for? Hard to say, isn't it. Seems a bit odd to list him as a co-author on an email citation.

I've been roundly lambasted enough for my assignation of 'small slights' to gender that it's probably worth it to dig in, at least a little bit, as to why this 'weirdness' is the sign of something ... sinister? Look, that's the thing about misogyny -- it bubbles up in these werid aberrations of treatment. Why can't I be listed as the sole author of an email I wrote? Why was there even a question of listing a man alongside my name? I'm not saying the idea didn't come out of a conversation we had, but I do think it's a stretch of the citation process to not list my email as written by, well, me.

Weird breaks in convention, the odd amnesia that others have about work that I've clearly done, the attribution of my *elucidations* to someone WHO ISN'T ME is shitty. It sucks that it happens. It *shouldn't happen* but it does, with enough frequency for me to know that this is A Thing That I Should Not Be Surprised When It Happens.

My understanding of men is shaped by my interactions with them. Those interactions seem to include some amount of over-writing of my work, of amnesia, by this odd, chaperoning instinct. I've had to reshape how I think about how men understand women based on this dynamic -- it's not one I naively had. 

I think it's a worthwhile question to consider. Why do men struggle to fully credit and stand up women, to remember what they've done or even give them the benefit of acknowledging their work?

One working theory is that women provoke an emotional, irrational reaction in most men. Their way of dealing, or not dealing with it as the case may be, is to downplay their interactions with us. Easier to re-assign our work to man, who doesn't invoke such difficulty in consideration.

The other theory is based on a few lectures I've seen by Jordan Peterson. Basically, Peterson explains men's social dynamics via hierarchies. These hierarchies are *so* male focused -- women's relation to the hierarchy is either as prizes to be won via your position in said hierarchy or as chits to help you move up and down the 'manierarchy'.[1] The key point is that we're not an equal *part* of the hierarchy. We, women, are foreign bodies to the system. Our attempt to move within it is uncomfortable and foreign. However, one way to be acknowledged by the hierarchy (if you can really even call it that) is by giving you, or your idea, a male chaperone. This male chaperone signature makes it such that you can be properly recognized by the status sort algorithm.

## On Being Male
I don't really know how to end this. I've toyed with the idea of submitting a PR to remove the man's name from my email citation, since the paper is open source, but goddamn it if I'm going to submit myself to the ignobility of asserting myself in that arena. Someone else, fix this injustice for me lol.

For a while, my Github name was "neiL". I've heard that neiL's such a clever, hardworking fellow who puts time in on nights and the odd weekend. He's sees the big ideas that are worth making a reality -- the man's a real genius. Perhaps I'll ask him to have a look at it.


It'd be odd to write an entire post on citations without actually giving any so, here's the email I wrote back in November of 2018. [Proposal for Advertising Channel Liquidity](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2018-November/001532.html)    
Here's the paper where it's cited: [Lightning Pool](https://lightning.engineering/lightning-pool-whitepaper.pdf), citation #28.
